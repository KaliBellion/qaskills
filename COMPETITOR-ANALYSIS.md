## Market Overview

The AI agent skills marketplace is a rapidly growing category in 2026. The open SKILL.md standard (established by Anthropic and OpenAI) has created a fragmented ecosystem of directories, marketplaces, and curated collections. QASkills.sh occupies a unique niche: the only directory focused exclusively on QA testing skills.

### 6. Indirect Competitors — AI Testing Platforms

| Competitor | Focus | Threat Level |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Tricentis** | Enterprise AI testing platform | Low (different market segment) |
| **mabl** | AI-native test automation | Medium (targets same QA audience) |
| **Virtuoso QA** | No-code AI test automation | Medium (AI + QA overlap) |
| **TestMu AI (LambdaTest)** | AI-native testing cloud | Medium (established brand) |
| **testRigor** | AI-powered testing | Low (different approach) |

These platforms are AI testing *tools*, not skills directories. They solve different problems but target the same audience. QASkills.sh can differentiate by being the bridge between these tools and AI coding agents.
