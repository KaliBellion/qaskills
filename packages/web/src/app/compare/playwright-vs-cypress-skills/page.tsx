            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Playwright and Cypress take fundamentally different approaches to browser automation.
              Understanding these architectural differences is crucial because they affect how your
              AI agent writes tests with each framework.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              <strong className="text-foreground">Playwright</strong> uses the Chrome DevTools
              Protocol (CDP) and similar protocols for Firefox and WebKit to control browsers from
              outside the browser process. This out-of-process architecture means Playwright can
              control multiple browser contexts, tabs, and even different browser types
              simultaneously. It can intercept network requests at the protocol level, emulate mobile
              devices, test across different browser engines, and handle complex scenarios like
              multi-tab workflows or authentication across origins.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              <strong className="text-foreground">Cypress</strong> runs inside the browser alongside
              your application. This in-process architecture gives Cypress direct access to the DOM,
              window object, and application state — which enables its signature time-travel
              debugging and automatic waiting. However, it also means Cypress is limited to a single
              browser tab, cannot natively handle multiple origins (though cross-origin support has
              improved in recent versions), and historically had limited browser support beyond
              Chromium.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              When an AI agent writes Playwright tests, it naturally produces code that leverages
              multiple browser contexts, parallel test execution, and cross-browser assertions.
              When writing Cypress tests, the agent focuses on Cypress&apos;s command chain syntax,
              custom commands, and its unique approach to asynchronous handling. This is exactly why
              framework-specific skills matter — they teach the agent the idiomatic patterns for each
              framework.

              <strong className="text-foreground">End-to-End Testing:</strong> Both frameworks excel
              at E2E testing. Playwright&apos;s auto-waiting is built into every action (click, fill,
              navigation), making tests naturally stable. Cypress&apos;s retry-ability mechanism
              automatically retries assertions until they pass or time out. Both approaches
              dramatically reduce flaky tests compared to older tools like Selenium.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              <strong className="text-foreground">API Testing:</strong> Playwright has a first-class

              independently. Cypress provides <code className="rounded bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 font-mono text-xs">cy.request()</code> and
              <code className="rounded bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 font-mono text-xs">cy.intercept()</code> for
              API testing and network stubbing, which is particularly useful for mocking backend

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Playwright is generally faster for large test suites. Its built-in parallel execution
              distributes tests across multiple worker processes by default, and each worker can run
              tests in isolated browser contexts without launching separate browser instances. A
              suite of 100 tests can run across 4 workers simultaneously, cutting total execution
              time significantly.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Cypress tests run serially by default within a single browser instance. While
              Cypress Cloud offers parallelization across CI machines, local development typically
              runs tests one at a time. Cypress compensates with fast startup time and real-time
              feedback through its interactive test runner — you see each command execute in the
              browser as it happens, which is invaluable during test development and debugging.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              For CI/CD pipelines where execution time directly impacts developer productivity,
              Playwright&apos;s native parallelism is a clear advantage. For local development where
              you are iterating on individual tests, Cypress&apos;s interactive runner provides a
              superior developer experience.

              Yes, and many teams do. A common pattern is to use Cypress for component testing and
              developer-facing integration tests (leveraging its excellent interactive debugger),
              while using Playwright for full E2E regression suites that need to run across multiple
              browsers in CI. You can install both the Playwright and Cypress skills into your AI
              agent — the agent will use the appropriate framework patterns based on the context of
              your project and the files you are working with.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              QASkills.sh also offers skill packs that bundle related testing skills together. The
              Web Testing Starter Pack includes both Playwright and Cypress skills along with
              accessibility and visual testing patterns, giving your AI agent comprehensive knowledge
              across the testing spectrum.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Both Playwright and Cypress are excellent testing frameworks, and the right choice
              depends on your team&apos;s needs. Playwright offers broader browser coverage, faster
              parallel execution, multi-language support, and more flexibility for complex testing
              scenarios. Cypress provides a smoother onboarding experience, an unmatched interactive
              debugger, and a mature ecosystem of plugins.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Regardless of which framework you choose, installing the corresponding QASkills.sh
              skill into your AI agent ensures it writes tests using the right patterns, proper
              assertions, and framework-specific best practices. No more generic test code — your
              agent becomes a testing expert for your chosen framework.
