              The most significant difference between QASkills.sh and SkillsMP is specialization.
              QASkills.sh was built from the ground up as a QA-first platform. Every skill in its
              directory targets a specific testing discipline: end-to-end testing with Playwright and
              Cypress, API testing with Postman and REST Assured, performance testing with k6 and
              JMeter, security testing with OWASP ZAP, accessibility testing with axe-core, and
              mobile testing with Appium.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              SkillsMP takes a broader approach. With over 66,000 skills spanning the entire software
              development lifecycle, it covers everything from frontend development and DevOps to
              data science and documentation. QA testing skills exist on the platform, but they
              represent a small fraction of the total catalog. If you search for &quot;Playwright&quot;
              on SkillsMP, you may find results, but they sit alongside thousands of unrelated skills
              — and there is no specialized curation to ensure those testing skills follow industry
              best practices like Page Object Model, proper test isolation, or data-driven patterns.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              QASkills.sh, backed by The Testing Academy (189K+ subscribers), ensures every published
              skill adheres to real-world QA standards. Skills are reviewed for content completeness,
              correct use of testing patterns, proper framework configurations, and practical examples
              that engineers can use immediately.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              QASkills.sh takes a curated approach: 48+ skills, each with an algorithmic quality
              score from 0 to 100. The scoring system evaluates content completeness, metadata
              accuracy, description depth, and token count. High-scoring skills appear prominently
              in search results and on the leaderboard, creating a natural incentive for authors to
              produce excellent content. Every skill is validated against a Zod schema before
              publication, ensuring structural consistency.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              SkillsMP prioritizes breadth, listing 66,000+ skills submitted by its community. While
              the sheer volume means you can find skills for almost any topic, the quality varies
              significantly. Some skills are thorough and well-maintained; others are minimal
              placeholders. SkillsMP uses community ratings and download counts as quality signals,
              which can be helpful but are lagging indicators — a new skill from an expert may have
              zero downloads while an outdated one still ranks high from historical popularity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              For QA engineers who need reliable, production-ready testing patterns, the curated
              approach typically saves time. You spend less effort evaluating whether a skill is
              trustworthy and more time actually writing tests.

              model works well for teams that need commercial support, but individual QA engineers

              work with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, Aider, Continue,
              Codex CLI, JetBrains AI, Zed, and many more.

              SkillsMP has a broader developer community contributing skills across all disciplines.
              This diversity is a strength for general-purpose use, but it means QA skills are
              authored by contributors with varying levels of testing expertise. The platform&apos;s
              community rating system helps surface quality content over time, but new or niche
              testing skills may take longer to gain visibility.

              QASkills.sh and SkillsMP serve different needs. If you are a QA professional looking

              cost, QASkills.sh is the clear choice. Its QA specialization, open-source model, and

              If you need a broader catalog that covers the entire development lifecycle and are
              comfortable evaluating quality yourself, SkillsMP&apos;s massive library offers
              something for almost every use case. Many teams use both platforms — QASkills.sh for
              their testing workflow and SkillsMP for general development skills.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              The best part: both platforms support the same SKILL.md standard and the same AI
              agents, so you are never locked in. Try QASkills.sh for your QA needs and see the
              difference curated quality makes.
